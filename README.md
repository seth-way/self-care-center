## Abstract

How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. My challenge was to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This solo coding challenge gave me the opportunity to get a pulse on where I'm at with the foundational concepts Javascript, HTML & CSS.
