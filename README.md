## Abstract

How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. My challenge was to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This solo coding challenge gave me the opportunity to get a pulse on where I'm at with the foundational concepts Javascript, HTML & CSS.

## Context

I completed this project in my 3rd week as a fulltime Turing student. This was our first real deep dive into custom CSS & building our own HTML structure. This project took roughly 10-12 hours to complete.

## Contributors

This repository was built by [Seth Way](https://github.com/seth-way).

## Learning Goals

- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
- Write HTML & CSS to match a provided comp.
- Understand how to listen to & respond to user events.
- Individualize my programming skill set.
- Work with new concepts such as SVG animations, @media breakpoints, & async functions.
- Project requirements can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

## Wins + Challenges

- I used this project to challenge myself to learn new CSS techniques. I was able to learn how animate SVGs & apply smooth background transitions. I also learned techniques to avoid that might slow down the responsiveness of a site & lead to a lesser user experience.
- I worked with @media breakpoints for the first time. I was able to successfully make changes for an optimized mobile experience.
- I used async functions, promises, & the setTimeout function to allow time in a synchronous function for CSS transitions. Normally, slowing down an action in such a way may be a negative, but for this usecase, it allowed me to show off my SVG animations. It also fit well with the over all 'calming' theme of the app.
- I was able to complete the project ahead of schedule.
